# Euler equation

## proof
Various proofs of the formula are possible

### using differentiation
This prrof shows that the quotient of the tirgonometric and exponential expressions is constant function one, so they must be equal (the exponential function is never zero, so this is permitted).  
Consider the function $f(\theta)$  
$f(\theta)={cos\theta + sin \theta\over e^{i\theta}}=e^{-i\theta}(cos\theta + sin\theta)$  
for the real $\theta$, Differentiating gives by the product rule.  
$f'(\theta)=e^{-i\theta}(icos\theta - sin\theta) - ie^{-i\theta}(cos\theta + isin\theta)=0$  
Thus, $f(\theta)$ is constant, since $f(0)=1$, then $f(\theta)=1$ for all real $\theta$, and thus  
$e^{i\theta} = cos\theta + isin\theta$
